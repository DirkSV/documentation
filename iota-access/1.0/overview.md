# Access overview

**IOTA Access is an open-source framework for controlling access to resources such as vehicles, wallets, and sensor data.**

With Access, you can build and embed applications inside your resources to do the following:

- Grant and revoke access at any time
- Charge users for access
- Set access restrictions

## Limitations

Access is a work in progress, and the project should be seen as a [*minimum viable product*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP).

## Source code

The source code for this project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/iotaledger/access-server).

## Next steps
