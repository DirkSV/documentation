# Steps involved

**You can transfer any amount of IOTA tokens on an IOTA network without any fees. This section guides you through the steps involved in transferring IOTA tokens.**

In this section, you will do the following:

## Step 1. Create a seed

To transfer IOTA tokens, you need to create a secret password called a seed, which is the master key to your [account](../accounts/overview.md).

## Step 2. Generate two addresses

All addresses have a balance of IOTA tokens that is kept on all nodes in an IOTA network. To start transferring IOTA tokens, you need an address.

## Step 3. Get IOTA tokens

IOTA tokens on the Mainnet have a monetary value. To send test transactions, you can use a faucet to get test IOTA tokens.

## Step 4. Send a signed transaction

When you have test IOTA tokens, you can transfer them to other addresses by signing a bundle of value transactions and sending them to a node.
