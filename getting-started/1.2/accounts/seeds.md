**A seed is a unique master key that gives you the ability to prove your ownership of either messages and/or any IOTA tokens that are held on your addresses.**

## Seed format

A seed is a string of 81 [trytes](../the-tangle/ternary.md) (or 90 trytes with a [checksum](../accounts/checksums.md)).

## Maximum number of seeds

The total number of possible seeds is almost unlimited (8.7 x 10<sup>115</sup>). As a result, the chances of two seeds being the same is very unlikely.

## Next steps

Learn about the [addresses](../accounts/addresses.md) that belong to seeds.

To simplify the process of securing your seed, sending transactions, and managing your account, you can use a [wallet](../accounts/wallets.md).
