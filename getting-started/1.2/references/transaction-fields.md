# Transaction fields

**This topic describes all the fields in a transaction object.**

A transaction consists of 2,673 tryte-encoded characters. When decoded, the transaction trytes form an object with the following fields.

:::info:
In the Tangle, transactions are not stored with the transaction hash. This field is calculated when needed by hashing the rest of the fields in the transaction.
