# How addresses are generated

**This topic describes the process involved in generating an address from a seed.**

All addresses are generated using the [Kerl](../references/glossary.md#kerl) hash function, which starts by generating a private key from a seed, an index, and a security level. For details about Kerl, see the [Kerl GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/kerl).

First, the seed and index are converted to trits, then they're combined and hashed to generate a 243-trit subseed.

```
Kerl(seed + index)
```

The subseed is then absorbed and squeezed in a sponge function 27 times for each [security level](../references/glossary.md#security-levels).

The result of the sponge function is a private key whose length varies, depending on the security level.

To generate an address, the private key is split into 81-tryte segments. Then, each segment is hashed 26 times. 

:::info:
A group of 27 hashed segments is called a key fragment, and a private key has one key fragment for each security level. For example, a private key with security level 1 consists of 2,187 trytes, which is 27 x 81-tryte segments or one key fragment.

Each key fragment is hashed once to generate one key digest for each security level. Then, the key digests are combined and hashed once to generate an 81-tryte address.
