# Cryptography in IOTA

**This section provides an overview of the cryptography that's used in IOTA technology.**

In this section, you learn the steps involved in the following cryptographic processes:

- [How addresses are generated](../cryptography/addresses.md)

- [How Merkle root addresses are generated](../cryptography/merkle-tree-address.md)

- [How checksums are generated](../cryptography/checksums.md)

- [How proof of work is calculated](../cryptography/proof-of-work.md)

- [How signatures are created and verified](../cryptography/signatures.md)
