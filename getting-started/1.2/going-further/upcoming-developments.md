# Upcoming developments

**The IOTA Foundation are working on some exciting developments to the IOTA technology stack.**

See the [Roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/) for timelines on all these projects. 

## Coordicide

Coordicide is a project with the goal of removing the Coordinator from IOTA networks, and allowing nodes to use decentralized consensus rules.

See the [Coordicide website](https://coordicide.iota.org/) for details.

See the [GoShimmer node software](root://goshimmer/1.0/overview.md) to keep up to date with the prototype Coordicide network.

## IOTA Smart Contracts

IOTA Smart Contracts is a project for automated agreements in the Tangle.

For a detailed look at how IOTA Smart Contracts may work, see [An Introduction to IOTA Smart Contracts](https://blog.iota.org/an-introduction-to-iota-smart-contracts-16ea6f247936) on Medium.

## Unified Identity

Unified Identity is a project for allowing people, businesses, devices and anything else to identify themselves online, while remaining fully in control of this process.

For details, see the whitepaper: [The Case for a Unified Identity](https://files.iota.org/comms/IOTA_The_Case_for_a_Unified_Identity.pdf).
