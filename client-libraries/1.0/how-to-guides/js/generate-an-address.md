# Generate an address in Node.js

**In this tutorial, you learn how to generate a new address for a seed with a given security level.**

## Packages

To complete this tutorial, you need to install the following package:

--------------------
### npm
```bash
npm install @iota/core
```
---
### Yarn
```bash
yarn add @iota/core
```
--------------------

## IOTA network

In this tutorial, we connect to a node in the [Devnet](root://getting-started/1.1/networks/overview.md).

## Code walkthrough

1. Require the packages

    ```js
    const Iota = require('@iota/core');
    ```

2. Connect to a node

    ```js
    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({
    provider: 'https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443'
    });
    ```

3. Define the security level that you want to use for your address

    ```js
    const securityLevel = 2;
    ```

4. Define a seed for which to generate an address

    ```js
    const seed =
    'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX';
    ```

5. Use the [`getNewAddress()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md#module_core.getNewAddress) method to generate an unspent address

    ```js
   IOTA.getNewAddress(seed, { index: 0, securityLevel: securityLevel, total: 1 })
        .then(address => {
            console.log('Your address is: ' + address);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.log(err)
        });
    ```

Starting from the given index, the connected node checks if the address is spent by doing the following:

- Search its view of the Tangle for input transactions that withdraw from the address
- Search for the address in the list of spent addresses

If an address with the given index is spent, the index is incremented until the IOTA node finds one that isn't spent.

:::warning:
This way of generating addresses replies on the IOTA node to return valid data about your addresses. To have more control over your addresses, we recommend using the [account module](../../account-module/introduction/overview.md) to keep track of spent addresses in your own local database.
:::

In the console, you should see an address.

```
Your address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA
```

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You've just generated a new address. You can share this address with anyone who wants to send you a transaction.
