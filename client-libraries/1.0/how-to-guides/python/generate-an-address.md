# Generate an address in Python

**In this tutorial, you learn how to generate a new address for a seed with a given security level.**

## Packages

To complete this tutorial, you need to install the following package:

```bash
pip install pyota
```

## IOTA network

In this tutorial, we connect to a node in the [Devnet](root://getting-started/1.1/networks/overview.md).

## Code walkthrough

1. Import the packages

    ```python
    from iota import Iota
    ```

2. Define a seed for which to generate an address

    ```python
    seed = 'PUETPSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX'
    ```

3. Connect to a node

    ```python
    api = Iota('https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443', seed, testnet = True)
    ```

    :::info:
    The `testnet` argument sets the [minimum weight magnitude](root://getting-started/1.1/first-steps/sending-transactions.md#doing-proof-of-work) to 9.
    :::

4. Define the security level that you want to use for your address

    ```python
    security_level = 2
    ```

5. Use the [`get_new_addresses()`](https://pyota.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#get-new-addresses) method to generate an unspent address. If the connected node has an input transaction that withdraws from the address with the given index, the IOTA node knows that the address is spent, so the library returns the next unspent address.

    ```python
    address = api.get_new_addresses(index=0, count=1, security_level = security_level)['addresses'][0]
    ```

    Starting from the given index, the connected node checks its view of the Tangle for any input transactions (pending or confirmed) that withdraw from the address.

    If an address with the given index has any input transactions associated with it in the Tangle, the index is incremented until the IOTA node finds an unspent one.

6. Check if the address is in the IOTA node's list of spent addresses

    ```py
    is_spent = api.were_addresses_spent_from([address])['states'][0]

    if is_spent:
        print('Address %s is spent!' % address )
    else:
        print('Your address is: %s' % address )
    ```

    :::info:
    We check this list because, unlike old transactions, nodes never delete it, so it's always available.
    :::

    :::warning:
    This way of generating addresses replies on the IOTA node to return valid data about your addresses. To have more control over your addresses, we recommend keeping a record of spent ones in your own local database.
    :::

In the console, you should see an address.

```
Your address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA
```

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You've just generated a new unspent address. You can share this address with anyone who wants to send you a transaction.
