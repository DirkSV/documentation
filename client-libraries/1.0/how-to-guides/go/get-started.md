# Get started with the Go client library

**To help you get started with the Go client library, this workflow topic walks you through the essentials from sending a zero-value transaction to transferring IOTA tokens and monitoring a node for live Tangle data.**

:::info:
The sample code for these tutorials is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/go-iota-workshop).

## What you will learn

If you complete this guide from beginning to end, you'll learn everything from generating addresses to listening for live transaction in the Tangle.

2. [Read transactions from the Tangle](../go/read-transactions.md)

3. [Generate an address](../go/generate-an-address.md)

4. [Transfer IOTA tokens](../go/transfer-iota-tokens.md)

5. [Check the balance of an address](../go/check-balance.md)

6. [Listen for live transactions in the Tangle](../go/listen-for-transactions.md)
